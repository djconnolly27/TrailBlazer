# After the Architectural Review

## Feedback and Decisions

We were surprised by the number of people interested in our product and they provided a lot of useful feedback on features that we should add. People cared a lot about the elevation, type of terrain, closeness of cars and number of intersections. We now plan to incorporate their feedback into our product. 

We also learned that we need to further define our MVP. The audience did not understand what platform our data would be represented and how the user would interact with the data. Going forward, we have further definined our MVP to be an algorithm that uses the Google Maps API to predict new paths for runners. 
 
We had come up with the idea for defining non-overlapping running paths using polygons but unfortunately do not seem to have fully explained this idea to our audience. As a result, we received many questions during the review and many comments after the review regarding how this polygon path structure will work. 

## Review Process Reflection
	
Due to going first, we ended up not following our planned agenda as closely as we thought we would. We went through everything in the same order as we planned to, but we took less time to describe our product and plan than we thought we would, and the question period was a lot longer than we expected. We also didn’t use the question time as optimally as we could have, since we weren’t prepared for the structure and timing we ended up using.

We managed to get some answers to our questions, although not to all of them. One of our questions was rather specific to two programs that others haven’t necessarily used, so we didn’t get any feedback on those like we had hoped.
