Project Description:
We intend to create a program that visualizes exercise data and suggests new routes for the future. In our program, a user will be able to input data through a gps enabaled device to track their runs. We will also build a database of routes by scraping websites like Strava and compiling those routes into maps. Our algorithm will then use that data to suggest new routes that are a users specified length. 

Background Information:

Good Routes - Our team has defined a good route as a non-overlapping path that starts and stops at the same point and is unlike the last route taken by a given user.

GMPlot - We will use Google Maps Plot to display our data ontop of a map of that area. This will help us verify if our new route suggestor is sugesting valid paths. If we have extra time, we may do something else and create a novel way to visualize our data. 

Strava API - To create a database of existing running paths, we will scrape data from Strava. Stava is a popular app where users upload and share their gps tracked, running and cycling activities. 

Key Questions:

How can we use machine learning?
What information do runners want?
What else makes a good route?
How could we best visualize this data?
