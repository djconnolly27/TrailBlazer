# Project Description:

An application for runners where the user inputs  their starting location and distance and our program spits out a path for them to run. 

Our program also has other features like the dayâ€™s weather forecast.


# Background Information:

* Tkinter - A GUI for the users to interface with our software.
* Overpy - An API off which we pulled datapoints of run-able paths. 
* NetworkX - A program that takes our points, finds the shortest paths and creates a graph.
* Weather API - Returns current weather data from Yahoo Weather. 

# Key Questions:

* What is a good strategy for approaching route finding?
* How do we change the pixelation of the font in the GUI?
* Is there a better way to structure our edge class?
* What is a faster way to run our find_nodes_and_edges function?
