# After the Architectural Review

## Feedback and Decisions


For our questions about the GUI, we asked about a specific bug we were having about changing the font. From this we learned that to change the font, we need to access the font from a file path within the documents of the computer.


We also asked about how to approach cycle finding in the context of our project. The answers we received ranged from “Google it” to a full layout of how to use a recursive function to search for paths. We plan on both further researching the current strategies for cycle finding and implementing the recursive function that Makenzie helped us create. 


## Review Process Reflection
	
Overall, we think the review went well. For the second architectural review we asked were more advanced and specialized about the technical aspects of our project. This made it difficult for anyone to answer as not everyone knows about the certain algorithms or GUI we are using. These specific questions lead to a smaller quantity of feedback but higher quality answers to our questions. 

In the structure of the presentation, this time we were more prepared and made a slideshow. This helped the audience better understand what we are making and made sure that we stayed on topic. To make the technical review even more effective we could have added a google form at the tend to better assess if the audience understood our product. This form could also check if they had any other suggestions or questions about our product.
