## What is it?
Trail Blazer is a route suggestion GUI that helps people on foot find new routes that never take them through the same location twice. 

## Features:
Trail Blazer allows a user to click a location on a map and provide a desired distance and then finds and displays a nonoverlapping route that meets the user's criteria on a map. Test is out for yourself by following the instructions found [here](run.md).
