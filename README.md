### What is it?
Trail Blazer is a route suggestion GUI that helps people on foot find new routes that never take them through the same location twice. Though some prefer to take the most efficient possible paths to every destination in life, Trail Blazer arose out of a deep-seeded desire for exploration. The team behind the GUI have worked tirelessly to help quench the thirst of those that, like the team itself, make an effort to find new paths at every opportunity. Never wanting to return home via the same path taken to reach the outbound destination, the team came up with the idea for a resource that helps evoke the explorer within us by suggesting running, walking, or biking routes that satisfy the distance and location specifications of users without ever routing you through the same point twice. This goal - to help people more fully realize the adventurer within themselves - underlies every aspect of the GUI and every line of code that contributed to producing it.
