# Trail Blazer
Final Project Route Finding App
By Daniel Connolly, Raquel Dunoff, and Lydia Hodges

### Description
Trail Blazer will help generate and visualize new routes for runners, walkers, and bikers. We are creating this for our Software Design final project.

### Modules
To run our program, please install the following modules:

Install GMPlot - https://github.com/vgm64/gmplot 

Flask - run the following in the command line: conda install Flask

Geopy - run the following in the command line: pip install geopy

Polyline - run the following in the command line: pip install polyline

Overpy - run the following in the command line: pip install overpy

Weather API - run the following in the command line: pip install weather-api

Currently, you will need a Google Maps Directions API key as well as a Google Maps Geocoding API key in order to run our program.

### Running the Program
Our code is broken up into several different files at the moment, including intersections.py, plot_a_route.py, weather_app.py, and map_app.py. Map_app.py will run plot_a_route.py as a module, but the other files run independently of one another at the moment.
